    "# Part 1) Choice of Data Source\n",

    "For this analysis, we utilize two datasets:\n",
    "- **Fast Food Restaurants Across America** (Kaggle): A list of 10,000 fast food restaurants, including each restaurant's name, address, city, state, and geographic coordinates.\n",
    "- **Dangerous Places in USA: 2013 - 2018** (Kaggle): A record of incidents of gun violence in the USA from 2013 to 2018, including location (latitude/longitude) and incident details (number of people injured/killed, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Format and Structure:** Both datasets are provided as CSV files. The fast food dataset is split across two CSV files which we will merge. The gun violence dataset is a single large CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Pitfalls and Quirks:**\n",
    "- The fast food dataset is split into two files with overlapping entries. We need to merge them and remove duplicates.\n",
    "- State names in the fast food data are given as two-letter abbreviations; we'll convert these to full state names for clarity.\n",
    "- Date fields are in string format (ISO timestamp) and need parsing to datetime.\n",
    "- Some entries have missing data, e.g., missing coordinates. We will drop those records since location is critical for our analysis.\n",
    "- In the gun violence data, multiple gun types or statuses can be listed in one field as combined strings (separated by '||' or in '::' format). This requires parsing if we want to analyze gun types.\n",
    "- The gun violence dataset is large, so performance and memory need to be considered when processing (e.g., writing out chunks to Excel, using efficient merges)."

    "- **Handle Missing Fields:** In the older fast food file, the `primaryCategories` field might be missing. We add this column if necessary to merge the datasets properly.\n",
    "- **Standardize State Names:** We convert state abbreviations (e.g., 'CA') to full names (e.g., 'California') for clarity.\n",
    "- **Normalize Dates:** Convert `dateAdded` and `dateUpdated` from string timestamps to a standard datetime format.\n",
    "- **Normalize Text:** Clean the restaurant names (strip whitespace, standardize casing) to avoid inconsistencies (e.g., 'McDonald\\'s' vs 'mcdonald\\'s').\n",
    "- **Remove Invalid Entries:** Drop any entries that lack crucial information (such as latitude or longitude) since we cannot map those.\n",
    "- **Load Gun Violence Data:** Load the gun violence incidents CSV and similarly drop incidents with missing coordinates.\n",
    "- **Prepare for Integration:** Ensure both datasets are in usable form. We write out the cleaned fast food data to a CSV (and Excel) for reference. We also prepare to combine the data sets by spatial location (this will be done in the exploration step by finding incidents within a certain distance of each restaurant)."

    "## Part 5) Fundamental Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "With clean data in hand, we now perform an exploratory data analysis on both datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics:** For each attribute in the fast food and gun violence data, we calculate summary statistics. Numerical attributes (e.g., latitude, longitude) have their count, min, max, mean, and standard deviation computed. Categorical attributes (e.g., restaurant category, incident factors) are tallied by frequency. Date fields are examined to find the time span covered and average frequency of records per day. Text fields (like URLs or description text) are analyzed by length.\n",
    "- **Geospatial Analysis:** We integrate the two datasets by spatial proximity. For each restaurant, we find all gun violence incidents within a 300 meter radius. This allows us to identify which restaurants had nearby incidents and how many.\n",
    "- **Identification of Extremes:** Using the results of the spatial join, we identify the restaurants with the highest number of incidents (and casualties) nearby. We then visualize the \"top 10 most dangerous\" restaurant locations using bar charts.\n",
    "- **Category Distributions:** We further explore specific aspects of the gun violence data, such as the proportion of incidents involving stolen guns and the distribution of types of firearms used. These are visualized with pie charts.\n",
    "- **Spatial Visualization:** Finally, we plot all restaurant locations on a map of the US, highlighting those with incidents. Restaurants with incidents are shown in colors (from green to red) indicating the number of incidents, while those with none are shown in blue, giving a visual overview of the data's geographic distribution."
