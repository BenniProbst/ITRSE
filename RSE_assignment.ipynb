    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will be your individual assignment and guide you through a data exploration workflow.\n",

    "### About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow you to switch between Markdown text and Python code to create an interactive document.\n",
    "This makes them very well suited for exploratory tasks, tutorials and explanations. \n",
    "Please make sure that you are familiar with the basic operation of these notebooks and can use the cells appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may always add additional cells if they help to better structure your text or code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handing in the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this notebook file (and only the notebook file) with your modifications.\n",
    "**Make sure you have listed all used frameworks and their version** (besides the Python standard library) **in Part 2** so we can run your code.\n",
